## About this project  
Pol Klusbedrijf did not yet have a website and was looking for a reliable partner to provide them with a professional online presence. They wanted a website that would not only help them immediately but also grow with the expansion of their business. Therefore, a custom-built website with a CMS was chosen, allowing Pol Klusbedrijf to easily manage and update their content.

## Our role  
I helped Pol Klusbedrijf by handling the full design and development of the website. This included the implementation of a user-friendly content management system, allowing Pol Klusbedrijf to easily maintain and adjust their website as their business grows.

## Highlights  
* Flexible CMS that can be easily extended as the business grows  
* Responsive website that works well on both desktop and mobile devices  
* Easy to maintain, so Pol Klusbedrijf can adjust content themselves

## Result  
A professional website that helps Pol Klusbedrijf present themselves online and support their growing business with a user-friendly content management solution.
