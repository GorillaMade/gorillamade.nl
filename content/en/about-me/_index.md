# About Me

My passion for websites began when I worked as a support assistant at a web hosting company. What started as curiosity about the technology behind websites quickly grew into a true passion. In 2008, I built my first website, and in 2025, I founded Made by Monkeys: my own company where I help local entrepreneurs become strong and independent online.

I build fast, secure, and easy-to-maintain websites using modern technologies such as Hugo, htmx, and Alpine.js. No standard templates or heavy systems, but custom solutions that are easy to manage and will last for years. You provide the content, and I take care of the technology, smart SEO optimizations, and a website that truly helps your business move forward.
